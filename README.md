This experiment was performed to compare sensitivities of alignment-independent and dependent methods for calling differentiall expressed genes. Alignment methods used here are:

1. Star (alignment dependent)
2. Kallisto (alignment independent)
3. Salmon (alignment independent) 

Shortly, alignment independent methods work by assigning the  most likely transcript for each read while alignment dependent methods align the reads to a reference genome. 
While alignment independent methods are significantly faster than the alignment dependent methods, alignment dependent methods are necessary for discovering novel features.
For the purposes of this experiment, I focused on both gene level and transcription level quantification for calculating loss of information through different workflows.
