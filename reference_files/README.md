This directory contains reference genome, transcriptome and the gtf file links that are  used for annotation.
As quoated from Ensembl, Fasta cDNA dumps that  include files hold the cDNA sequences corresponding to Ensembl gene predictions. cDNA consists of transcript sequences for actual and possible genes, including pseudogenes, NMD and the like. For genome primary assembly is used. It contains top level squence regions excluding haplotypes and patches.
